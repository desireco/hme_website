title: About us and what we do
---
So we are wife and husband team, Dragana Dakic (CEO) and Zeljko Dakic (CTO). We wanted to do something like this for a long time, opportunity and excuse came to be when YC announced 2019 Startup School. We were able to refine and prototype idea during the program.

Our goal is to create a new platform for business matching that would rival LinkedIn and more specialized platforms like AngelList. We have experience and time to refine idea of networking into new mobile product that can be useful to masses of business people and professionals.
